    <h1>Coding Projects</h1>
    <p>“Without a project, you aren’t learning, you’re simply giving yourself
      a passing acquaintance with some information”- someone</p>

    <h2>CodeBreakers</h2>
    <p>Practiced problem solving by solving algorithm problems on Leetcode. A
       lot more of the problems and solutions are yet to be uploaded. Python is
        the language used for this project.An online repository can be found on
       Github using this <a href = "https://github.com/bethwelkip/CodeBreakers">
         link.</a></p>

    <h2>Space Facility Controller</h2>
    <p>When calibrating space instruments worth millions, human error cannot
      be permitted to cause failure. For this project, I worked to create and
      code up the logic that would ensure the human operating the facility does
       not unintentionally make a costly error. The code is written in Python
       but is unavailable on GitHub but here is a
        <a href = "https://spacephysics.princeton.edu/">link</a> to the group I worked
       with.</p>
    <h2> Moringa Prep</h2>
    <p>in my pursuit of learning web development, I started
      <a href = "https://github.com/bethwelkip/moringa-prep">this repository</a> to
      document my work at Moringa School. I will be learning HTML, CSS and
      Javascript initially. The repository therefore is mostly in HTML for now</p>
    <p class = "note">Initial challenges with github has left most of the
      miniprojects under this project stuck in my local drive awaiting to be pushed
      on here.</p>
    <h2> Portfolio</h2>
    <p>The page you are viewing is a part of this project project. It forms the
    basis of what will eventually be my personal website. The main languages
    used in this project are CSS and HTML. Javascript may be introduced later.
    <a href = "https://github.com/bethwelkip/first-portfolio"> Here is a link
    to my online repository</a></p>
