    <h1>Coding Projects</h1>

    <h2>CodeBreakers</h2>
    <p>Practiced problem solving by solving algorithm problems on Leetcode. A
       lot more of the problems and solutions are yet to be uploaded. Python is
        the language used for this project.</p>
    <h2>Space Facility Controller</h2>
    <p> When calibrating space instruments worth millions, human error cannot
      be permitted to cause failure. For this project, I worked to create and
      code up the logic that would ensure the human operating the facility does
       not unintentionally make a costly error. The code is written in Python
       but is unavailable on GitHub but here is a
        <a href = "https://spacephysics.princeton.edu/">link</a> to the group I worked
       with.</p>
