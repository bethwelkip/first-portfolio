    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Bethwel Kiplimo</strong>, a resident of Nakuru, Kenya. I'm currently a
      rising senior at <em>Princeton University</em> studying Mechanical and Aerospace
      Engineering.  On campus, I was the Physics head tutor at the McGraw Center
       for Teaching and Learning, a head fellow with the SIFP program and also
       a technical member of Engineers Without Borders-Kenya Team. This summer
       I have been working on developing a control
      system for a particle accelerator. I will be on a gap year for this
       upcoming academic year.</p>
    <p>My interests span control theory, engineering design,  entrepreneurship,
       and computer science. My hobbies include <em>taking photos</em>(of literally
       anything), <em>reading short stories</em> and <em>biking</em>.The following are some of my
       favourite photos I have taken of places and of my friends.</p>
    <p>My favourite short stories are those of the Russian writer, Anton Chekhov
    .These are my top 10 books by Anton Chekhov:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A happy ending</li>
        <li>Fat man and Thin Man</li>
        <li>The black Monk</li>
