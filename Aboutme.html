    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Bethwel Kiplimo</strong>, a resident of Nakuru, Kenya. I'm currently a
      rising senior at <em>Princeton University</em> studying Mechanical and Aerospace
      Engineering. This summer I have been working on developing a control
      system for a particle accelerator. I will be on a gap year for this
       upcoming academic year.</p>
    <p>My interests span control theory, engineering design,  entrepreneurship,
       and computer science. My hobbies include <em>taking photos</em>(of literally
       anything), <em>reading short stories</em> and <em>biking</em>.The following are some of my
       favourite photos I have taken of places and of my friends.</p>
    <p>My favourite short stories are those of the Russian writer, Anton Chekhov
      . These are my top 10 books in order:</p>
