    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Bethwel Kiplimo</strong>, a resident of Nakuru, Kenya. I'm currently a
      rising senior at <em>Princeton University</em> studying Mechanical and Aerospace
      Engineering.  On campus, I was the Physics head tutor at the McGraw Center
       for Teaching and Learning, a head fellow with the SIFP program and also
       a technical member of Engineers Without Borders-Kenya Team. This summer
       I have been working on developing a control
      system for a particle accelerator. I will be on a gap year for this
       upcoming academic year.</p>
    <p>My interests span control theory, engineering design,  entrepreneurship,
       and computer science. My hobbies include <em>taking photos</em>(of literally
       anything), <em>reading short stories</em> and <em>biking</em>.The following are some of my
       favourite photos I have taken of places and of my friends.</p>
    <p>My favourite short stories are those of the Russian writer, Anton Chekhov
    .These are my top 10 books by <em>Anton Chekhov</em>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A happy ending</li>
        <li>Fat man and Thin Man</li>
        <li>The black Monk</li>
        <li>The lady with the dog</li>
        <li>Excellent people</li>
        <li>Strong Impressions</li>
        <li>The chemist's wife</li>
        <li>Death of a government clerk</li>
        <li>The man in a case</li>
        <li>The head of the family</li>
      </ol>
      <p> Others that I have really enjoyed, in no particular order, are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vanka</li>
        <li>A story without a title</li>
        <li>A living Chattel</li>
        <li>On Official Business</li>
        <li>GooseBerries</li>
        <li>The bet</li>
      </ul>
      <p> If any of them piques your interest, the books are all located in
        this online <a href = "https://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/ac/jr/"> database
         </a></p>
      <p> As to why I chose to attend Moringa, I view programming as an art and
         as a way to show the world your ideas and products, and it is one art I
          have always wanted to learn. When the prospect of taking a gap year
          showed up on my mind, I figured this was the time I would finally get
           to learn programming.</p>

      <p> Outside of my hobbies and interests, I love getting to know people and
         being helpful wherever I can :) </p>
